# Power factor and phase angle simulation

This project shows how to conduct Power factor calulations via simulations on simulink.

Major selection for "Loadflowwithsolarbasis16.3kWp.slx" model:

- Three phase source is Yg with Vrms at 400V
- Powergui solver is Discrete 5e-05
- Impedence is not specified
- Load flow is set to swing

## Getting Started

To run this demo:
1. Ensure that the three phase load is RLC in series
2. Nominial phase to phase is 400Vrms
3. Enter active power value
4. Enter reactive and capacitive power values
5. Select run

## Toolbox Requirements
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Simscape
- Simscape Electrical
